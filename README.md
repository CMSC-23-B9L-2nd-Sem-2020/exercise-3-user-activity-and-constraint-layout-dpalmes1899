Lights Outs - Solution Code
===================================


Introduction
------------
The Lights Out app demonstrated how to use the ConstraintLayout using the Android Studio's Layout Edior. This app consists of clickable TextView views that change colors when tapped and chained Button views. It also implements the editText and TextViews. 

The goal is to turn off all the lights given that when a square is clicked, the adjacent cells are toggled or turned off.
